# An Analytical Study on Mental Health Care Trends in the United States

## **Overview**
This project presents a **data-driven exploration** of mental health care trends in the United States. It leverages publicly available datasets to identify **demographic disparities**, geographic variations, and temporal trends in mental health care access and usage. The study uses advanced **data analysis techniques** and visualization tools to uncover insights that can inform public health policies and resource allocation.

---

## **Objectives**
The primary objectives of this study are:

1. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Examine temporal trends in mental health care usage during various phases of the pandemic.

2. **Demographic Disparities:**
   - Analyze how mental health care usage varies across demographic groups such as gender, age, and income levels.

3. **Geographic Insights:**
   - Investigate state-wise variations in mental health service utilization.

4. **Statistical Confidence:**
   - Assess the reliability of estimates using confidence interval analysis.

5. **Policy Recommendations:**
   - Provide actionable insights to guide policymakers in improving mental health care systems.

## **Results**

- **Demographic Trends:** Younger adults (18â€“29) reported higher mental health care usage.
- **Regional Disparities:** The Midwest showed lower mental health service utilization compared to other regions.
- **Temporal Insights:** Significant fluctuations in mental health care usage were observed during specific periods of the pandemic.
- **Statistical Reliability:** Confidence interval analysis revealed variability in the precision of estimates across different subgroups.
